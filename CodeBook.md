# CodeBook for the home assignment on module 3 R course

## The data:
This repository contains a copy of a dataset available [here:](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
The data contains information on 30 persons doing six different activities wearing a smart phone on the waist. Acceleration and gravitational force were recorded in 3 dimensions 50 times a second during the activity. From this additional information was calculated hereunder mean and standard deviation for each measurement during the activity. This additional information was already included in the primary dataset.

## The transformation:
The primary data from the original dataset available in /test/X_test.txt and /train/X_train.txt have been merged. Before that, ID number available in /test/subject_test.txt and /train/subject_train.txt have been added to each record along with information on what activity was done on each record, the last available in /test/y_test.txt and /train/y_train.txt.
The primary data were not labeled from the beginning and information on each measurement have been taken from the features.txt file and added as labels for the variables.
From this dataset containing 563 variables, the ones containing information on mean and standard deviation have been filtered to a smaller dataset with 81 variables.
The participants were recorded numerius times during each activity so the original data contains 10299 records.
From this an average of each variable made by each person doing one of six activities were calculated.
